## Welcome to My Recipe Book 📖
This recipe book came about when I wanted to fix an in real life issue that I have when it comes to cooking.
I LOVE trying out new recipes, and when coming across one I tend to either write my recipe out on a piece of paper or take a screenshot of it.
This is fine and all when cooking at the time, until... this piece of paper gets lost, or the screenshot gets buried in the my photo album.
So, I wanted to make it easier for me to store my favourite recipes without having to look them up again (i know, very lazy).
