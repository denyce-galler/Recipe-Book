Welcome to my Recipe Book! 

This recipe book came about when I wanted to fix an IRL issue that I had when it comes to cooking.
I LOVE trying out new recipes, and when coming across one I tend to either write my recipe out on a piece of paper or take a screenshot of it.
This was fine and all at the time, until this piece of paper gets lost, or the screenshot gets buried in the my photos album.
So, I wanted to make it easier for me to store my favourite recipes without having to look them up again (i know, very lazy).
