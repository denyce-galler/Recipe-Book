## Welcome to My Recipe Book 📖
This recipe book came about when I wanted to fix an in real life issue that I have when it comes to cooking.
I love trying out new recipes, and when coming across a new one to do, I tend to either have it up on my browser, write my recipe out on a piece of paper or take a screenshot of it or sometimes use my notes app.
This is fine when I'm already making the recipe, until... this piece of paper gets lost, or the screenshot gets buried in the my photo album and notes.
To fix these issues, I wanted to make it easier for me to store my favourite recipes without having to look them up again.
